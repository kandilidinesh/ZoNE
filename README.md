This is a Android Application for the DotMatrixMessaging repository which I created for sending the message via MQTT to the broker. The topic for publishing and subscription can be modified with the java files available in this application. Client side is WizWiki w7500 and WizFi. This is used to connect to Dot Matrix using the DotMatrix library.
